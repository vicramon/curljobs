Hi!

I saw your job post on the (HN Who's Hiring list | 37 Signals job board). Your company appears to be forward thinking, so I was hoping to get your feedback on a project I'm working on that could possibly benefit you.

The project is designed help devs and companies by circumventing techincal recruiters entirely.

Here's how it would work: I would gather a list of skilled developers who are looking for work, then each week I would email a portion of list out to companies that are hiring.

Companies could choose which candidates they want to interview (if any). Companies would pay us a small fee (like $99) to interview a dev, and that's it. There would be no hiring fees or anything.

So it's kind of like weekly deals for companies that are looking for devs. Devs could get a lot of interviews quickly, and companies could get connected to devs that they wouldn't have otherwise known about.

Is this something that you would be interested in? Please let me know. I'm trying to determine if this is something worth building.

Thanks for your time.


Best regards,

Vic Ramon
