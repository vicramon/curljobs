Hi!

I saw your job post on the (HN Who's Hiring list | 37 Signals job board). Your company appears to be forward thinking, so I was hoping to get your feedback on a project I'm working on that could possibly benefit you.

The project is designed help devs and companies by circumventing techincal recruiters entirely.

Here's how it would work: I would gather a list of skilled developers who are looking for work, then each week I would email a portion of list out to companies that are hiring.

Companies could choose which candidates they want to interview (if any). Companies would pay us a small fee (like $99) to interview a dev, and that's it. There would be no hiring fees or anything.

So it's kind of like weekly deals for companies that are looking for devs. Devs could get a lot of interviews quickly, and companies could get connected to devs that they wouldn't have otherwise known about.

Is this something that you would be interested in? Please let me know. I'm trying to determine if this is something worth building.

Thanks for your time.


Best regards,

Hi!

How are you? I'm contacting you because I saw your job posting on (place).

I'm a developer trying to make techincal recruiting not suck. My project is called Curl Jobs, and I'm launching it next week. I'd like to invite you to join if you're interested.

Here's how it works: Once a week we'll send you a list of skilled devs who are looking for work. It will be free to get the email and free to hire anyone you meet through it. Our only fee is $99 to interview a prospective candidate.

Is this something that you and your company would be interested in? Please let me know. I'll be launching with a list of about 40 top-notch developers that I have obtained through my own personal connections, though I'll also be doing other marketing activities to get more devs.

Please let me know what you think!


Best regards,

Chris Bryant
